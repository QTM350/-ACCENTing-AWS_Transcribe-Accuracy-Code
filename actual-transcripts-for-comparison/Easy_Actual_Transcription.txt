The world needs you. Stop being boring! Yeah, you! Boring is easy. Everybody can be boring whether you're good or not. Life is not a game, people! Life isn't a cereal either. Well, it is a cereal. And if life was a game, aren't we on the same team? I mean, really right? I'm on your team. Be on my team. This is life, people! We got air coming through your nose.. A poem, "two roads diverged in the woods.. and I took the road less traveled.." And it hurt, man! Really bad! Rocks! Thorns! and Glass! Not cool, Robert Frost! But what if there really were two paths? I want to be in the one that leads to awesome. It's like that dude Journey said, "Don't stop believing  unless your dream is stupid", then you should give up your dream. I think that's how it goes. You better dream to keep going. Keep going, keep going, and keep going.  What if Michael Jordan had quit? Well, he did quit. No, he retired. Yeah. Yes, he retired. But before that, in high school. What if he quit when he didn't make the team? He would never make Space Jam and I love Space Jam. What will be your Space Jam? What will you create to make the world awesome? Nothing if you keep sitting there! That's why I'm talking to you today. This is your time! This is my time! It's our time! We can make everyday better for each other. If we're all on the same team, let's start acting like it. We got work to do. We can cry about it or we can dance about it. We were made to be awesome. Let's get out there. I don't know everything. I'm just a kid but I know this, it's everybody's duty to give the world a reason to dance so get to it!
